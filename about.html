                <h3>Learning Goal & Task</h3>
                <p>
                    Initial learning goal to takeaway from this project was to translate information into a digital
                    visualisation by creating an appropriate structure and digital design. The task that we were given
                    was designing a mid-fidelity prototype of an educational
                    app that could be used as a learning toolbox for
                    UXD students at my university for the first year course, Design and Creativity.
                </p>

                <h3>Inital Idea</h3>
                <p>
                    Educational resources find their mediums in varying digital forms nowadays. This course project
                    is devoted to the user interface design of a resource library for creative techniques incl.
                    diverging and converging techniques learned during the course. The task was to design a mobile
                    user interface of a mobile app which includes a resource library where newly learned material
                    can be inputed once learned i.e. add a new technique and serve an as educational toolbox. Each
                    technique within the library includes a visual (showing the technique in action), a list of
                    requirements (for best results), and the goal (of the technique and what it can bring to the
                    designer.)

                </div>

                <h3>Vision</h3>
                <p>
                    The main task of an educational application is a convenient and understandable transfer of
                    information. The goal is to create an educational toolbox that is simple, convenient and
                    user-friendly. <br>I intended for the design to be clean and minimalistic and for the structure
                    to be organised and usable.</br>
                </p>
