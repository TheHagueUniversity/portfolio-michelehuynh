                <p>
                    UX designers are investigative designers. To better understand our end users as designers, it is
                    integral to understand our users better through research means - to be able to design a product with
                    good usability that can be enjoyed.
                    Research can help us spark inspiration and make founded choices in our design process.
                    For the Research and Design module we learned and conducted user trialling, one of the UX research
                    methods.

                    This app lets you see all the paintings/exhibitions/favorite museum goer routes within the museum,
                    guides you to exact location/orientation within the museum, allows you to purchase entry tickets,
                    gives you access to the museum shop, and also allows you to create a personal Rijksmuseum account.
                </p>

                <h3>Our Aim</h3>
                <p>
                    Given a massive turn in consumer behavior, mobile apps are now an increasingly popular choice and
                    medium for content and services. With this user trialling, we further examine if the Rijksmuseum app
                    is useful, relevant and valued for its users. To ensure positive and seamless app experience within
                    the app - we will be doing user trialling as we observe and listen to our users engage with the app.

                    <p class="spec-title">

                <p>
                    Usability consists of effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction. These three are measured by
                    observing use actions, usability problems, and users’ perceptions of performed interactions.
                    Emphasis is placed on the qualitative because only with understanding of interaction difficulties
                    can a design be optimised.
                </p>

                <h3>Research Questions</h3>
                <p>
                    To translate from aim of the project to the base of research we defined a few research
                    questions to lead us from preparations to actual points of interest for our trialling.

                <h3>Conducting Research</h3>
                <p>
                    Given a massive turn in consumer behavior, mobile apps are now an increasingly popular choice and
                    medium for content and services. With this user trialling, we further examine if the Rijksmuseum app
                    is useful, relevant and valued for its users. To ensure positive and seamless app experience within
                    the app - we will be doing user trialling as we observe and listen to our users engage with the app.

                </div>

                <h3>Results & Recommendations</h3>
                <p>
                    After conducting research in form of trialling and interviewing sessions we came to a few
                    conclusions and results. These results we layed down into design recommendations and directions for
                    further app redesign.

                <p>
                    Right now the only
                    way to find a painter or painting would be to mindlessly scroll through
                    Rijksstudio until you find it. By adding a search bar, the user can quickly
                    see if the painting/painter they want to see is featured in rijksstudio and if
                    not, they won't need to waste their time, this is much more efficient for the
                    user.

                    Information about the paintings
                    differ and some of them lack the location of the painting in the museum. We would recommend putting
                    an option when user clicks on the number

                    The app offers the option to log in via facebook but this
                    option failed 80% time of our testing this option should be either fixed or
                    deleted because it only creates confusion and irritates the user

                <p>
                    The app should also include
                    perhaps a FAQ or an instruction video with voice explanation to help
                    users navigate more smoothly throughout the app. Currently: there are 7
                    image explanation of how to navigate the app (found: the help icon) and a
                    video with the same 7 aforementioned images compiled into a video
                    (found: “info” on the top middle right of the app).
