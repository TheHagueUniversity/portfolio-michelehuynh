                <h3>Yes to coding!</h3>
                <p>
                    Everything in the design or perhaps as well in the UX world needs to at some point be coded. And
                    without it, we wouldn‚Äôt be able to push any product or service into the world for all to enjoy and
                    experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To be able to stay relevant to the user needs and have an influence on the products development and
                    the end results - UX designers should understand the workings of code, eventually learn to code and
                    become proficient in coding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To be able to work with and alongside developers, UX designers should understand the ins and outs of
                    coding to be able to gauge their design limitations and achieve their intended design. Programming
                    is an essential skill during each part of the design process. It is used along side other
                    techniques, to stimulate creativity, validate design solutions and communicate resulting products.

            <p>
                Everything in the design or perhaps as well in the UX world needs to at some point be coded. And
                without it, we wouldn‚Äôt be able to push any product or service into the world for all to enjoy and

                    Task
                    <p class="spec-description">
                        Use Processing to create a more elaborate game that features a main character or avatar and
                        enemies or obstacles.

            <p>
                The game ‚ÄúJump Jump Wars‚Äù is inspired by Star Wars. Being a big fan of 8bit and 16bit graphics - I
                decided to incorporate that classic 80s style of blocky and simplistic design.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before starting to program the game, the game play that I sketched the game play that I intended to
                create. While ideating, I had a concept that I wanted to execute and I did this:
            </p>
            <div class="image">
                <img src="images/processing-notes.png" class="mdc-icon-button__icon" />
            </div>

            <h3>Result</h3>
            <p>
                The main character/avatar of this game is Princess Leia. The platforms are meant to be there for jumping
                and landing purposes. And the falling characters or ‚Äúenemies‚Äù are Darth Vader, Yoda, Storm Trooper and
                R2D2.
            </p>
            <div class="image">
                <img src="images/processing-result.png" class="mdc-icon-button__icon" />
            </div>
            <p>
                I calculated the distance between the enemies which are falling down (at randomised locations) and their
                distance from Leia.
