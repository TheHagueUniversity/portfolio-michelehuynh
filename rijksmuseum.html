                <h3>Design Brief</h3>
                <p>
                    UX designers are investigative designers. To better understand our end users as designers, it is
                    integral to understand our users better through research means - to be able to design a product with
                    good usability that can be enjoyed.
                    Research can help us spark inspiration and make founded choices in our design process.
                    For the Research and Design module we learned and conducted user trialling, one of the UX research
                    methods.

                    This app lets you see all the paintings/exhibitions/favorite museum goer routes within the museum,
                    guides you to exact location/orientation within the museum, allows you to purchase entry tickets,
                    gives you access to the museum shop, and also allows you to create a personal Rijksmuseum account.

                <h3>Our Aim</h3>
                <p>
                    Given a massive turn in consumer behavior, mobile apps are now an increasingly popular choice and
                    medium for content and services. With this user trialling, we further examine if the Rijksmuseum app
                    is useful, relevant and valued for its users. To ensure positive and seamless app experience within
                    the app - we will be doing user trialling as we observe and listen to our users engage with the app.

                </p>
                <div class="spec red">
                    <p class="spec-title">
                        Aim

                            Finding the usability flaws within the Rijksmuseum app

                <p>
                    Usability consists of effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction. These three are measured by
                    observing use actions, usability problems, and users‚Äô perceptions of performed interactions.
                    Emphasis is placed on the qualitative because only with understanding of interaction difficulties
                    can a design be optimised.
                </p>

                <h3>Research Questions</h3>
                <p>
                    To translate from aim of the project to the base of research we defined a few research
                    questions to lead us from preparations to actual points of interest for our trialling.

                <h3>Conducting Research</h3>
                <p>
